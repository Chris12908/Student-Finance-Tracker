Finance Tracker


//What this app does ?

Finance Tracker is a small, simple web app that helps you record and track your personal spendings. You can add transactions, give each one a date, amount, description and category, and the app saves everything in your browser so you don't lose your data.

//Where your data is stored ?

Data is stored locally in your browser (localStorage). That means your data stays on your computer and is not sent to any server.

//Quick start (open and use)

1. Open the project folder and double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser (or serve the folder with a simple static server).
2. Use the navigation links to go to "Add Transaction" and add some records.
3. Visit the Dashboard to see summaries and charts.
4. Go to Settings to change currency, exchange rates, categories, or theme. Use the "Save Settings" button to keep your choices.

//Tests

- Open `tests.html` in your browser to run a small set of validation tests and see a demo form that shows inline validation errors.

That's it! this app is designed to be simple and easy to use.
